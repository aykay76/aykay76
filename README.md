### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my slice of Github! I'm here to blog my development interests and activities, and to share the things I learn in case they can be of use to others.

I tend to have a preference for backend programming (i'm not very creative) but I also like the fact that I can build apps using web technologies that can then be used across Windows, Mac and Linux (Bootstrap helps to make them pretty without much effort). Most of what you find here will be C# based, as I've been using that for 20 years now, since before it was released. There is also a fair amount of Javascript and Go also. Javascript because I have been involved in web development since the mid-late 1990s and Go because it was something new to learn and is easy to prototype things with.
