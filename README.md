### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my slice of Github! I'm here to blog my development interests and activities, and to share the things I learn in case they can be of use to others.

I tend to have a preference for backend programming (i'm not very creative) but I also like the fact that I can build apps using web technologies that can then be used across Windows, Mac and Linux (Bootstrap helps to make them pretty without much effort). 

I've been programming for 30 years, about 20 of those professionally. I'm more of a hobby developer these days, always looking to learn new things and definitely open to collaboration.
