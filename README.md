### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Alan.

With 30+ years in IT, Iâ€™ve worn many hatsâ€”starting as a curious software developer and evolving into a tech generalist with deep roots in both code and infrastructure. My career has been a mix of building, scaling, and reimagining systems, and Iâ€™m now focused on the exciting intersection of software and AI.

## Early Days: The Code-First Era
I began my journey as a software developer, where I fell in love with the craft of building. Over 15 years, I wrote code for everythingâ€”from low-level operating system concepts to high-level scripts, even creating my own programming language (complete with a compiler and interpreter!). Iâ€™ve worked across platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android) and built software for web, desktop, servers, and mobile. My toolkit grew to include C, C++, C#, Java, Go, and TypeScript, with hands-on experience in ASP, PHP, .NET, Node.js, and a range of databases, messaging, and caching technologies. Those early years taught me to value clean, purposeful codeâ€”and the thrill of turning ideas into functional systems.

## The Infrastructure Chapter: Scaling What I Built
After a decade and a half in development, I shifted gears to tackle the backbone of tech: infrastructure. For 15 years, I worked with physical and cloud-based systems, managing environments for Windows and Linux, and getting deep into VMware, Azure, and AWS. This phase taught me to think holisticallyâ€”how code interacts with servers, networks, and scalability. It was a natural evolution: understanding the "bigger picture" of where and how software runs made me a better developer.

## Today: Back to Development, Now with AI
These days, Iâ€™ve circled back to software developmentâ€”but with a fresh perspective. Now, I focus on system design and architecture, leaving the hands-on coding to tools like Claude (though I still love geeking out over technical details!). My current passion? Building software that enhances human and developer experiencesâ€”especially by integrating AI to solve real problems, streamline workflows, or make tech more intuitive.

When Iâ€™m not diving into system diagrams or exploring AIâ€™s latest capabilities, youâ€™ll find me [optional: add a personal touch, e.g., "tinkering with side projects, hiking local trails, or cheering on my favorite sports team"].

Letâ€™s connectâ€”Iâ€™m always up for a conversation about tech, AI, or the next big idea!
