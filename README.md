### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my slice of Github! I'm here to blog my development interests and activities, and to share the things I learn in case they can be of use to others.

I've been programming for 30 years, about 20 of those professionally. I'm more of a hobby developer these days, always looking to learn new things and definitely open to collaboration.
